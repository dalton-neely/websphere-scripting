The AdminTask object enables the execution of available admin
        commands.  AdminTask commands operate in two modes:
        the default mode is one which AdminTask communicates with the WebSphere
        server to accomplish its task. A local mode is also available, in which
        no server communication takes place. The local mode of operation is
        invoked by bringing up the scripting client using the command line
        "-conntype NONE" option or setting the
        "com.ibm.ws.scripting.connectiontype=NONE" property in
        wsadmin.properties file.

The number of admin commands varies and depends on your WebSphere
install. Use the following help commands to obtain a list of supported
commands and their parameters:

help -commands                  Lists all the admin commands
help -commands <pattern>        Lists admin commands matching with wildcard
                                "pattern"
help -commandGroups             Lists all the admin command groups
help -commandGroups <pattern>   Lists admin command groups matching with
                                wildcard "pattern"
help commandName                Displays detailed information for the
                                specified command
help commandName stepName       Displays detailed information for the specified
                                step belonging to the specified command
help commandGroupName           Displays detailed information for the specified
                                command group

There are various flavors to invoke an admin command. They are

commandName                     Invokes an admin command that does not require
                                any argument.

commandName targetObject        Invokes an admin command with the specified
                                target object string, for example, the
                                configuration object name of a resource
                                adapter. The expected target object varies
                                with the admin command invoked. Use help
                                command to get information on the target
                                object of an admin command.

commandName options             Invokes an admin command with the specified
                                option strings. This invocation syntax is
                                used to invoke an admin command that does
                                not require a target object. It is also
                                used to enter interactive mode if
                                "-interactive" mode is included in the
                                options string.

commandName targetObject options        Invokes an admin command with the
                                        specified target object and options
                                        strings.  If "-interactive" is included
                                        in the options string, then interactive
                                        mode is entered.  The target object and
                                        options strings vary depending on the
                                        admin command invoked. Use help command
                                        to get information on the target object
                                        and options.
