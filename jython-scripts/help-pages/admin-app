The AdminApp object allows application objects to be manipulated
        -- this includes installing, uninstalling, editing, and listing. Most
        of the commands supported by AdminApp operate in two modes: the default
        mode is one in which AdminApp communicates with the WebSphere server to
        accomplish its tasks.  A local mode is also possible, in which no
        server communication takes place.  The local mode operation is invoked
        by bringing up the scripting client with no server connected using the
        command line "-conntype NONE" option tor setting the
        "com.ibm.ws.scripting.connectionType=NONE" property in the
        wsadmin.properties.

        The following commands are supported by AdminApp; more detailed
        information about each of these commands is available by using the
        "help" command of AdminApp and supplying the name of the command
        as an argument.
