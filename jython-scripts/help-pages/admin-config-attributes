Method: attributes

        Arguments: type

        Description: Displays all the possible attributes contained by an
        object of type "type."  The attribute types are also displayed; when
        the attribute represents a reference to another object, the type of
        the tattribute has a suffix of "@."  When the attribute represents a
        collection of objects, the type is listed with a suffix of "*."  If the
        type represents a base type, possible subtypes are listed after the
        base type in parenthesis.  If the type is an enumeration, it is listed
        as "ENUM," followed by the possible values in parentheses.
