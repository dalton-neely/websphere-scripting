The Help object has two purposes:

        First, provide general help information for the objects
        supplied by wsadmin for scripting: Help, AdminApp, AdminConfig,
        AdminControl and AdminTask.

        Second, provide a means to obtain interface information about
        MBeans running in the system.  For this purpose, a variety of
        commands are available to get information about the operations,
        attributes, and other interface information about particular
        MBeans.

        The following commands are supported by Help; more detailed
        information about each of these commands is available by using the
        "help" command of Help and supplying the name of the command
        as an argument.
