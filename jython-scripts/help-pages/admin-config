The AdminConfig object communicates with the Config Service in a
        WebSphere server to manipulate configuration data for a WebSphere
        installation.  AdminConfig has commands to list, create, remove,
        display, and modify configuration data, as well as commands to display
        information about configuration data types.

        Most of the commands supported by AdminConfig operate in two modes:
        the default mode is one in which AdminConfig communicates with the
        WebSphere server to accomplish its tasks.  A local mode is also
        possible, in which no server communication takes place.  The local
        mode of operation is invoked by bringing up the scripting client with
        no server connected using the command line "-conntype NONE" option
        or setting the "com.ibm.ws.scripting.connectionType=NONE" property in
        the wsadmin.properties.

        The following commands are supported by AdminConfig; more detailed
        information about each of these commands is available by using the
        "help" command of AdminConfig and supplying the name of the command
        as an argument.
