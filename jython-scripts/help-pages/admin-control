The AdminControl object enables the manipulation of MBeans running
        in a WebSphere server process.  The number and type of MBeans available
        to the scripting client depends on the server to which the client is
        connected.  If the client is connected to a Deployment Manager, then
        all the MBeans running in the Deployment Manager are visible as are all
        the MBeans running in the Node Agents connected to this Deployment
        Manager, and all the MBeans running in the application servers on those
        nodes.

        The following commands are supported by AdminControl; more detailed
        information about each of these commands is available by using the
        "help" command of AdminControl and supplying the name of the command
        as an argument.

        Note that many of these commands support two different sets of
        signatures: one that accepts and returns strings, and one low-level
        set that works with JMX objects like ObjectName and AttributeList.
        In most situations, the string signatures are likely to be more useful,
        but JMX-object signature versions are supplied as well.  Each of these
        JMX-object signature commands has "_jmx" appended to the command name.
        Hence there is an "invoke" command, as well as a "invoke_jmx" command.
